# Journey 11 — Analytics, Insights & Reporting

> How much is lean-ctx actually saving you? Where is context being wasted? Which
> commands are slow? This journey covers every reporting, measurement, and
> "show me the numbers" surface — without ever costing the agent extra tokens
> (all of this is CLI / dashboard, not injected context).

Source files referenced here:
- `rust/src/cli/dispatch/analytics.rs` — `gain` (all modes)
- `rust/src/tools/ctx_gain.rs`, `core/stats/` — savings engine
- `rust/src/cli/session_cmd.rs` — `wrapped`
- `rust/src/cli/tee_cmd.rs` — `tee`, `filter`, `slow-log`
- `rust/src/cli/dispatch/network.rs` — `dashboard`, `watch`

## 0. The principle

> Per the project's own rule: lean-ctx never prints "↓80% saved" into agent
> context — that would burn tokens. Savings live **here**, in the CLI and
> dashboard, where a human looks at them.

So analytics is a pull model: nothing is added to your agent's window; you run a
command when you want the numbers.

## 1. `gain` — the savings dashboard

`lean-ctx gain` is the single entry point, with one mode per question:

```bash
lean-ctx gain                      # headline savings summary
```

| Flag | Answers |
|------|---------|
| `--live` (`--watch`) | live-updating savings as you work |
| `--graph` | savings over time, sparkline |
| `--daily` | per-day breakdown |
| `--cost` | dollar cost saved (model-priced) |
| `--score` | efficiency score |
| `--tasks` | savings grouped by task |
| `--agents` | savings grouped by agent (see Journey 8) |
| `--heatmap` | which files/commands save the most |
| `--wrapped` | "Spotify Wrapped"-style recap |
| `--pipeline` | provider-pipeline processing stats |
| `--deep` | everything: report + tasks + cost + agents + heatmap |
| `--json` | machine-readable (for scripts/CI) |
| `--reset` | clear all savings data |

Refinements: `--model <name>` (price against a specific model), `--period <p>`
(time window, default `all`), `--limit <n>` (rows, default 10).

> Start with `lean-ctx gain`; reach for `--deep` when you want the full picture
> in one shot, or `--cost --model gpt-4o` to put a dollar figure on it.

## 2. `wrapped` — the shareable recap

```bash
lean-ctx wrapped                   # (also: lean-ctx gain --wrapped)
```

A celebratory, screenshot-friendly summary of tokens/cost saved over a period —
good for sharing with your team or justifying the tool to a lead.

---

## 3. `token-report` — tokens + memory

```bash
lean-ctx token-report              # tokens saved + memory footprint
lean-ctx token-report --json
```

Where `gain` focuses on savings, `token-report` (alias `report-tokens`) adds the
memory side: how much session/knowledge/cache state lean-ctx is holding.

---

## 4. Finding waste — `discover` and `ghost`

```bash
lean-ctx discover                  # commands in your shell history that ran uncompressed
lean-ctx ghost                     # "ghost tokens": hidden waste lean-ctx could catch
lean-ctx ghost --json
```

- `discover` scans shell history for commands you ran *without* lean-ctx — your
  "you could have saved more here" list.
- `ghost` quantifies waste that's currently slipping through, so you know
  whether tightening compression (Journey 10) is worth it.

---

## 5. Performance — `slow-log`

```bash
lean-ctx slow-log list             # slowest commands lean-ctx wrapped
lean-ctx slow-log clear
```

If lean-ctx ever feels like it's adding latency, this tells you exactly which
commands were slow to compress, so you can exclude or filter them.

---

## 6. Output logs — `tee`

```bash
lean-ctx tee list                  # captured output logs
lean-ctx tee last                  # the most recent
lean-ctx tee show <id>
lean-ctx tee clear
```

`tee` keeps a log of compressed command outputs so you can recover the *full*
output of something you ran earlier without re-running it.

---

## 7. The web dashboard — `dashboard`

```bash
lean-ctx dashboard                 # http://localhost:3333
lean-ctx dashboard --port 4000 --host 0.0.0.0
```

A browser UI over everything in this journey: live savings, heatmaps, sessions,
knowledge, agents. The richest way to explore; ideal for a second monitor.

> This dashboard is the home for the UX feedback in issue #249 — it's where
> context-management visualization lives, distinct from the CLI numbers.

---

## 8. The live TUI — `watch`

```bash
lean-ctx watch                     # real-time event stream in the terminal
```

A terminal dashboard (no browser) showing the live event stream — reads,
compressions, cache hits — as they happen. Great for confirming "is lean-ctx
actually intercepting this?" in real time.

---

## 9. Quality scoring — `cep` and `benchmark`

```bash
lean-ctx cep                       # CEP score trends (Context Engineering Protocol)
lean-ctx benchmark run             # run the benchmark suite
lean-ctx benchmark report          # results
lean-ctx benchmark eval / compare  # evaluate / compare runs
```

- `cep` tracks the Context Engineering Protocol score over time — a measure of
  how well-structured the agent's context has been.
- `benchmark` measures compression quality/throughput so regressions are caught
  (also used in CI, Journey 9).

---

## 10. Learning loops — `learn` and `gotchas`

These turn observed history into durable insight:

```bash
lean-ctx gotchas list              # recorded bugs/footguns ("bug memory")
lean-ctx gotchas stats / export / clear
lean-ctx learn                     # learned gotchas
lean-ctx learn --apply             # promote them into AGENTS.md
```

- `gotchas` (alias `bugs`) is a memory of mistakes/footguns hit in this project.
- `learn --apply` promotes high-value lessons into your agent rules — the
  analytics-to-governance bridge (pairs with `export-rules`, Journey 10).

---

## 11. Raw stats & transcript compaction

```bash
lean-ctx stats                     # raw stats store summary
lean-ctx stats json                # raw JSON
lean-ctx stats reset-cep           # reset CEP scores only
lean-ctx compact [path]            # compress stored agent transcripts
```

`stats` is the low-level store behind `gain`; `compact` shrinks saved agent
transcripts so long histories don't bloat the data dir.

## Storage & data (analytics)

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|

| gotchas/bug memory | recorded footguns |

## UX notes captured during this walkthrough

- `gain` has 12+ modes that aren't discoverable from `gain` alone; §1 tabulates
  every one so users stop guessing flag names.
- The deliberate "no savings text in agent context" rule is stated up front (§0)
  so users understand *why* the numbers only live in the CLI/dashboard.
- `discover`/`ghost` (waste finders) and `learn`/`gotchas` (learning loops) are
  powerful but obscure; grouped here by intent so they're actually found.
