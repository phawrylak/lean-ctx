# lean-ctx Reference — Every Function, Every Path

This is the complete, function-by-function reference for lean-ctx, organized
the way you actually meet it: as a sequence of **user journeys**, starting at
setup and walking through everything lean-ctx can do.

Each journey document answers three questions for every feature:

1. **What does it do?** (plain language)
2. **How do I use it?** (the exact command / MCP call)
3. **What happens under the hood?** (which code path runs, what files change)

## Cross-cutting references

| Reference | What's in it |
|-----------|--------------|
| [CLI command map](appendix-cli-map.md) | Every CLI command + alias, one line each |
| [MCP tool map](appendix-mcp-tools.md) | Every MCP tool, params, and which profile exposes it |
| [Paths, env vars & config](appendix-paths-and-config.md) | Data dir layout, every `LEAN_CTX_*` var, every config key |
| [Glossary](appendix-glossary.md) | MCP, CCP, hooks, modes, profiles, proxy — in one place |

## The two mental models you need

lean-ctx has exactly **two ways** of helping your AI, and almost every command
belongs to one of them:

- **MCP tools** — your AI editor calls `ctx_*` tools instead of its native file
  reads/search. lean-ctx returns compressed, cached results. (Journeys 2–5.)
- **Shell hooks** — when you (or your AI's terminal) run `git`, `npm`, `cargo`,
  etc., lean-ctx compresses the output. (Journey 2.)

Everything else — sessions, knowledge, graph, proxy — exists to make those two
paths smarter. If you remember only that, the rest falls into place.

The journeys layer onto this: 1–4 are the core daily loop, 5 wires in external
systems, 6 keeps it healthy, 7 gives you fine-grained control of the window,
8–9 scale it to multiple agents and teams, and 10–11 let you tune behavior and
measure the payoff. Every CLI command and MCP tool appears in at least one
journey and in the appendices below.
